# esp8266-crypto-price
This is a simple program to display the current price and the history of a certain crypto currency.
I used the ESP8266 with a 0.96" OLED display. You can get these cheap on Aliexpress: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006082033773.html.
You'll probably never need this but I still had some fun programming it.
